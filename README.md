# Game: Earth Defense
A modified 3D version of Missile Command created for NCSU CSC 561 

The game is featured in space and is limited to area around the Earth (with an orbiting moon and a sun in distance). Asteroids are randomly spawned with Earth as its target. Three stations are built for both offense and defense purposes. They keep the barrier around Earth functional and also able to shoot missiles to explode the asteroids from a distance to keep them from reaching Earth.

The Earth will be defenseless once the stations are all striked down. Each station is capable of taking two hits. They will be able to automatically shoot the closest asteroid present once the 'Shot' command ("Spacebar") is pressed. A cooldown time is present after a missile has been fired, in which the stations cannot fire further missiles. The player will be able to command different stations by making use of the arrows. Scores will be gained whenever an asteroid has been shot down before reaching Earth.
